# UBHM-Portfolio
The following is a small web portfolio to showcase completed projects

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to create a portfolio that is capable of showcasing my skills to potential employers. Although awaiting the addition of future works, this portfolio will highlight my best works recently produced, complete with deployed applications and their links. Early iterations of this portfolio will contain placeholder projects, however these placeholders will be updated as more projects are completed and deployed.

The portfolio itself may see future updates, with earlier iterations viewable within this GitHub repos commit records. Future iterations may include, but are not limited to:

* Updated UI
* Inclusion of animations
* Replacement assets such as images

### Completed Task:

* Creation of a project portfolio showcase, that firstly introduces me, with links to different sections of the site.
* Use of semantic HTML.
* Organised CSS.
* UI auto scroll when navigation link is clicked.
* Project portfolio showcase, including titled projects and tech stacks.
* First project is larger than other projects.
* Users redirected to deployed project.
* Resizable responsive webpage, with a minimum recommended screensize of 600px horizontally.

## Installation

This single static website can be deployed either locally or to a webserver. With the included "index.html" file containing the main code for the website, and the accompanying "style.css" stylesheet. Alternatively, the website can be found on the GitHub Pages link below.

Designed primarily for a desktop experience, the site can be accessed on small screen sizes, with a minimum screensize of 600px horizontally. Please keep this in mind when accessing the site on your device.
